Rules:
  1.Rule 1: Only call Hooks at the top level
      avoid calling them inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. 
      Instead, it is recommended to always use Hooks at the top
      level of your React function.

  2.Rule 2: Only call hooks from react functions
      avoid calling Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.

  Understanding Effects: 
    Unlike componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate , the function that we pass to useEffect 
    fires after layout and paint, during a deferred event.
